imgurTheWorld
=============

"Imgur the world" is an easy way to put online images on http://imgur.com/

*Why ?*

Imgur is the best image hosting service : shorter links, faster display, longer hosting...

*How ?*

After the extension is installed you will see a little imgur icon appearing on the right side of the chrome address bar if you are viewing a imgur compatible image.
A click on the imgur icon will upload it to imgur and the new imgur link will be directly put in your clipboard.

OR

*You can now right click on any image and click "Upload to imgur" !*

Changelog :
v2.0: Add right click context menu support. Restrict permissions to http://imgur.com/*

If you are worried about the permissions take a look at the code.
Permissions required are : 
"permissions": [ "tabs", "http://imgur.com/*", "contextMenus" ],
All browsing history corresponds to the "tabs" permission that is required to open a tab and inject script in it (clipboard handling script)
